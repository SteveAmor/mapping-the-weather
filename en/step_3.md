## Mapping the Weather

One thousand weather stations were sent out to schools all over the world at the beginning of 2016, ready to be assembled and begin collecting global weather data.

Each weather station comes equipped with the sensors listed in the table below:

|Sensor name|Purpose - What does it measure?|
|-----------|-------|
|Rain gauge|Volume of rain falling in millimetres|
|Anemometer|Wind speed in kilometres per hour|
|Wind vane|Wind direction in degrees|
|Soil temperature probe|Soil temperature in degrees Celsius|
|Temperature sensor|Air temperature in degrees Celsius|
|Humidity sensor|Relative humidity of the air as a percentage|
|Pressure sensor|Atmospheric pressure in Pascals
|Air quality sensor|Air quality as a relative percentage|

The weather stations continually monitor the environment and send their data to an Oracle database, where it is stored and from which it can be accessed.

In this resource you're first going to fetch a list of online weather stations, and then plot them onto a map of the world.

You can then look at gathering data from all the available weather stations and plotting that weather data to the map.
